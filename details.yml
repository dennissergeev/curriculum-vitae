# Sections

profile: My interests include exoplanet atmospheric dynamics, general circulation of the atmosphere, polar meteorology. Most of my current research focuses on the atmospheric modelling of terrestrial planets. I hope to contribute to our understanding of the climate regimes on different planets and their potential for habitability.
