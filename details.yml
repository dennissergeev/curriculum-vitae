# Sections

profile: My interests include exoplanet atmospheric dynamics, as well as mesoscale meteorology and cyclone dynamics in high latitudes. Most of my current research focuses on the atmospheric modelling of extrasolar planets. I hope to contribute to our understanding of the climate regimes on different planets and their potential for habitability.
